=== VECTORS

mutable data type, so we don't need a COW, and we don't need an extra indirection to prevent copies
    value: ptr (=i64)
    value -> (bufptr, cap, len, ...buf)


=== STRINGS

immutable data type, so we need a COW, and an extra indirection to prevent unnecessary copies
    value: ptr (=i64)
    value -> (bufptr -> buf, len, nrefs)

example:

    let input = "abc" -- has 1 ref
    let first_line = input
        :lines -- underlying data is not copied, but, every line has 2 refs now
        [0]

    first_line[0] = "k" -- copied
